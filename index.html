                    I developed an interest in computers, computer games and hardware since my dad
                    bought the first PC for our home. I still remember, to this day,
                    being fasinated with the MS-DOS command-line and that I started
                    typing in it as if I was typing a story.

                    Looking back, I should have taken up Information Technology as a career
                    but the 16 year old me, at the time was afraid that the industry
                    would move too quickly for me to catch up. Instead, I studied
                    chemistry and materials engineering. Taking up web development
                    at 30+ years old is me going back to my roots and to hopefully
                    get my foot in the door in the IT industry.
